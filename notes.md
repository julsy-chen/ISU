# # Files & Directories
- Computer file: a digitital CONTAINER that stores structured and organized information, data, or instructions 
- Holds a variety of content (txt, imgs, audio, video, software code, etc.)
- Fundamental units of data storage and manipulation in a computer's file system
- Each field is indentified by a name and is stored wihtin a directory strcture
- Files are created, opened, edited, saved, and deleted by users or software apps
- Allow for the preservation & exchange of data across different systems and platforms
- Various file formats for specific types of data - define how the data is stored, interpreted, and presented
- Important for enabling computers to handle complex tasks by providing  ameans to organize & access data efficiently - important for the functionality and versatility of modern computing systems
- File extensions: suffixes added to the end of a file's name to indicate the file format; help the user and software how to handle a file - important for compatibility and proper display or execution

- Directory: aka a folder, organzes & stores files and other directories in a hierarchical manner on a computer's file system
- Important for organization, hierarchy, navigation, isolation, security, cleanliness
- The $HOME directory: "~" or "home directory", a concept in Unix-like operating systems critical for system hierarchy and is the default directory where a user's personal files & settings are stored

# Use of Command Line
- helps programmers with efficiency, flexibility, automation capabilities, remote access, and deeper system-level understanding
- (Windows) Command Prompt: basic command-line interpreter in Windows and allows the user to interact with the operating system using text-based commands to execute various commands (navigating the file system, running programs, managing files & directories, etc.) - while it's been a core part of Windows, it has limitations in terms of scripting and automation
- (Windows) PowerShell: more advanced & versatile command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft and offers more comprehensive set of tools & capabilities (automation, task scripting, and system administration tasks through its object-oriented scripting approach), built on the .NET framework -> allows users to manipulate various data sources (files, registry, services) as if they were objects
- (macOS) Teminal: application that allows for the user to enter text-based commands to perform tasks(navigtate file systems, run programs, manage files & directories, etc.) - similar to the Command Prompt and the shell in Unix-like systems

# Git & Github
- Git and GitHub provide a robust version control system, helps with collaboration and allows for open-source development, offers backup and recovery mechanisms, and itegrate with various tools to enhance the development workflow
- Git: a distributed version control system that helps developers manage and track changes to their source code and other files
    - allows for multiple people to collaborate on projects
    - maintains a history of changes, making it possible to see details of the changes made
    - widely used in software development but can be applied to types of projects where version control & collaboration are important
    - repository: a data structure that stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure 
- GitHub: a web-based platform that USES the Git version control system to facilitate collaboration on software development projects
    - provides tools and features for the user making it a popular platform for open-source and private software development
    - allows developers to share, contribute to, and collab on code and projects with a global community

# Markdown
- Markdown: a lightweight markup language that is widely used for the format & structure of plain text documents
- easy to read and write + easily converted into HTML or other formats
- file extension of .md
- README file: a text file that introduces and explains a project - contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about
    - often written as a markdown file
